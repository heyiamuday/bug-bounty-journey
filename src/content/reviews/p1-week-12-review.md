### Week 12 Review: The Foundation

This was **Week 12** of my first 12 Week Year cycle. The goal was simple: build a solid foundation for the journey ahead.

### Major Wins 🎯

1. **Environment Setup Complete**: Got Burp Suite Pro, OWASP ZAP, and all essential tools configured perfectly
2. **Learning Momentum**: Completed 20+ labs on PortSwigger Academy, focusing on SQL Injection and basic web vulnerabilities
3. **System Created**: Built my Obsidian vault with templates for daily logs, vulnerability notes, and checklists
4. **Platforms Joined**: Active on HackerOne and Bugcrowd with profiles set up

### Challenges Faced 🚧

The biggest challenge this week was **analysis paralysis**. I spent too much time perfecting my setup and consuming content instead of actually hunting. I need to remember: **execution over preparation**.

Also struggled with:
- Deciding which resources to focus on (there are TOO many)
- Balancing learning new concepts vs practicing what I know
- Not hunting actively enough - only spent ~5 hours on real targets

### Key Metrics

- **Total Study Hours**: 25 hours
- **Active Hunting Hours**: 5 hours
- **Labs Completed**: 20
- **Bugs Submitted**: 0 (not acceptable!)
- **Average Execution Score**: 8.5/10

### Next Week's Battle Plan 📋

For Week 11 (remember, we count down!), I'm shifting focus to **active execution**:

1. **Primary Goal**: Submit at least ONE bug report (duplicate or not)
2. **Learning**: Focus exclusively on XSS and CSRF
3. **Time Allocation**: Max 2 hours learning, minimum 3 hours hunting
4. **Targets**: Pick 3 programs and go deep instead of wide

### Mindset Shift

Week 12 was about **preparation**. Week 11 will be about **execution**. The clock is ticking - 11 weeks to make this quarter count!
