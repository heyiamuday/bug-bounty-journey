###  Week's 11 Game Plan 📋
For Week 11 (remember, we count down!), I'm shifting focus to **active execution**:
1. **Primary Goal**: (Atleast 5hrs/day bughunting on Wed,Thr,Fri,sat,sun) 
2. **Learning**: Read 40 writeups goal
3. **Time Allocation**: Max 4 hours learning, minimum 6 hours hunting
4. **Targets**: Pick 1 programs and go deep instead of wide
