### Velocity Metrics

Track these metrics weekly to maintain momentum:
- **Daily Active Hours:** Target 6+ hours of focused hunting/learning
- **Program Coverage:** Maintain 5+ active programs in scope
- **Submission Rate:** Target 1-2 reports per week by Q2
- **Acceptance Rate:** Track and optimize acceptance percentage
- **Bounty ROI:** Calculate earnings per hour invested

---

## Strategy Adjustments

This roadmap is a living document. Review and adjust quarterly based on:

- **Market Changes:** New vulnerability types, platform updates
- **Personal Performance:** Actual results vs. targets
- **Industry Trends:** Emerging technologies and threats
- **Learning Outcomes:** New skills and specialization opportunities

**Update Frequency:** End of each quarter (Weeks 12-10, 8-6, 4-2, 0)

---

## Getting Started

1. **Complete Q1 onboarding:** Set up environment, join platforms
2. **Establish daily routine:** Commit to 6+ hours daily
3. **Choose first programs:** Start with 2-3 programs from HackerOne
4. **Track progress:** Log daily activity and weekly reviews
5. **Review monthly:** Assess performance and adjust approach

**Remember:** Consistency over intensity. Sustainable 6 hours daily beats erratic 10-hour sessions. Focus on learning in Q1, execution in Q2, specialization in Q3, and mastery in Q4.
