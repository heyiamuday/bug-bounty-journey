## Today's Execution

Another productive day! I'm getting into the rhythm of daily execution.

### Completed
- ✅ Finished all beginner SQL Injection labs on PortSwigger (12/12)
- ✅ Practiced on TryHackMe SQL Injection room
- ✅ Created detailed notes on different SQL injection types
- ✅ Started building my vulnerability testing checklist

### Breakthrough Moment
I finally understood **union-based SQL injection**! The "aha moment" came when I realized it's about matching the number of columns. Practiced this on 5 different labs until it became second nature.

### Active Bug Hunting
Spent 2 hours on a practice target:
- Identified 3 potential injection points
- Successfully exploited 1 blind SQL injection
- Documented the entire process in my notes

### Tomorrow's Goal
Start learning about XSS vulnerabilities and complete at least 5 labs.

## Reflection
The daily execution is building momentum. Each small win compounds!
