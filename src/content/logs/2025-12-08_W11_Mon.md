## Today's Progress

Today marked the beginning of my 11 Week Year bug bounty journey! I'm excited and a bit nervous, but ready to commit fully to this process.

### What I Did
- Set up my testing environment with Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP
- Completed the first module of PortSwigger Academy on HTTP basics
- Started studying the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Created my bug bounty toolkit repository

### Key Learnings
The most important takeaway today was understanding the importance of **systematic reconnaissance**. I learned that rushing into testing without proper recon is like trying to find a needle in a haystack blindfolded.

### Tomorrow's Focus
- Continue with PortSwigger Academy (SQL Injection module)
- Set up my note-taking system in Obsidian
- Join 2-3 bug bounty platforms

## Mindset Check
Feeling motivated and committed. The 12 Week Year countdown creates a healthy sense of urgency. Week 12 → Week 1, let's go!
