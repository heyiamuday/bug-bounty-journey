## Today's Progress
Today marked the beginning of my 12 Week Year bug bounty journey. I'm excited and a bit nervous, but ready to commit fully to this process. Today was busy, so I focused on starting rather than chasing perfection.

### What I Did
- Spent 1 hour hacking (busy with family)
- Spent 30 minutes reading write-ups on UUID attacks
- Tested 8 API endpoints:
  - Login feature
  - OTP mode manipulation (e.g., changing "SMS" to "EMAIL")
  - JSON injection by adding additional fields

### Key Learnings
While hacking as a beginner bug hunter, I started questioning myself:
Am I doing this the right way?  
Should I open Twitter, HackerOne reports, or write-ups to figure things out right or wrong?  
Should I message others to ask how they treat each proxy request, track endpoints, or test every endpoint?

To handle this, I started a bullet journal—not just for productivity, but to unload mental noise. I write down every doubt, question, and comparison that pops into my head while hacking. Seeing them on paper helps me realize that most of these thoughts don’t need answers right now. The journal reminds me to stop overthinking and simply keep hacking—**these thoughts are just passing clouds.**

### Tomorrow's Focus (Top Priority)
- Test 30 API endpoints
- Spend 3–6 hours hacking

## Mindset Check
Don’t Let my Obstacles Define my Journey. Let’s go.
