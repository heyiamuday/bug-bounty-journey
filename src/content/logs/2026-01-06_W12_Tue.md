### Key Learnings
- It’s been two years since I opened Instagram—I have completely removed it from my life. Now, I use YouTube and Twitter only on Mondays.
- Tomorrow is the last day. I will return to my zone on January 8. Until then, my journey feels slow.
- I want to hunt, but I’m not able to do it. I experience stress when starting bug hunting. I’ve noticed that when I hunt with a stress-free mind, I’m more curious and my workflow reaches peak performance.
- Maybe I should create a routine or habits that push me forward no matter how much stress I’m facing in life. This way, I can stay stress-free and remain curious.

### Tomorrow's Focus (Top Priority)
- Start my day early & Bug hunting is first thing i need to do
- Test 30 API endpoints

## Mindset Check
Don’t Let my Obstacles Define my Journey. Let’s go.
