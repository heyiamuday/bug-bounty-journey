title: "Quarter 2: Execution Phase"
quarter: 2
theme: "Execution Phase - Scaling Bug Finding & Specialization"
---

## 12-Week Outcome

Apply Q1 fundamentals at scale, shift focus toward consistent bug discovery, measure results with concrete submissions, and begin specializing in high-impact vulnerability types.

**Goal:** Submit 5+ valid bug reports, find first moderate severity vulnerability, develop specialized testing workflow.

## Phase 1: Hunting Acceleration (Weeks 8-7)

### Goal Statement
Increase hunting velocity and apply systematic testing methodology to identify vulnerabilities.

### Focus Areas
- **Systematic Testing**
  - Develop personal testing checklist
  - Create automated reconnaissance scripts
  - Build vulnerability scanning workflow
  - Implement result tracking system

- **Scope Expansion**
  - Add 3+ programs to active scope
  - Target programs with history of payouts
  - Focus on responsive maintainers
  - Join 1+ private invitation programs

### Weekly Targets
- Hunt 20+ hours per week minimum
- Test 2+ new programs
- Submit 1-2 bug reports weekly
- Document testing process

---

## Phase 2: Specialization (Weeks 6-5)

### Goal Statement
Identify high-impact vulnerability types and develop deeper expertise in specialized areas.

### Focus Areas
- **Vulnerability Specialization**
  - Master at least 2 vulnerability types deeply
  - Study real-world CVE examples
  - Develop custom exploitation techniques
  - Create reusable exploitation templates

- **Advanced Techniques**
  - API security testing
  - Business logic vulnerabilities
  - Advanced authentication bypasses
  - Integration point exploitation

### Weekly Targets
- Deep dive into 2 vulnerability types
- Submit vulnerabilities from specialty areas
- Build 3+ exploitation templates
- Publish 1+ write-up/analysis

---

## Phase 3: Scaling & Refinement (Weeks 4-1)

### Goal Statement
Achieve consistent vulnerability discovery at scale and refine methodology based on results.

### Focus Areas
- **Result Analysis**
  - Review all submissions and feedback
  - Identify high-success vulnerability patterns
  - Calculate effective scope areas
  - Optimize testing priorities

- **Workflow Optimization**
  - Automate repetitive tasks
  - Reduce testing cycle time
  - Improve result documentation
  - Scale successful techniques

### Weekly Targets
- Maintain 25+ hunting hours weekly
- Achieve 2+ valid submissions per week
- Refine top 3 specialized techniques
- Optimize testing workflow
