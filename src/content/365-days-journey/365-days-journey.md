**Mistakes I did**

<aside>

As a mechanical graduate, who doesn’t touch keyboard, I don’t consider these as a mistakes 

</aside>

- I focused on become software developer rather than hacker, (Just look time allocation i spend overtime in coding)
- Feeling of learning seem winning but It’s opposite, The winning game is all about execution
- Only consistent on learning Not bug hunting
- Overloaded Task Lists: Led to burnout, Ignoring Financial Stress: Money worries disrupted focus during critical months (Aug 2024, May-July 2025).
- Late Nights leads to eye issues then wake-up Late morning starts then it becomes messy day
- I go hard on myself to move forward then i got Eye strain and TMJ pain/stress disrupted focus.

**Lessons I learnt**

- Deep Work Blocks: Isolation  3-5 hour focused sessions accelerated project completion.
- Health-First Approach: Yoga/meditation/sleep on time makes better life and improved consistency.
- Building web apps (Node.js, React, GraphQL) helps alot
- Knowledge is useless unless you applied it — It's not about no.of days or high hours count it's about quality of focused work
