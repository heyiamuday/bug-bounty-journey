## 🔄 Adaptive Strategy

This roadmap is **NOT** fixed. Update based on:
- Real learnings from the field
- Market changes (new platforms, program closures)
- Personal circumstances and capacity
- Emerging opportunities

**Review Schedule:**
- Weekly: Daily progress vs. weekly goals
- Monthly: Quarter progress, adjust tactics
- Quarterly: Review roadmap, update for next quarter

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Platform Priority:** HackerOne > Bugcrowd > Others
- **Vulnerability Focus:** OWASP Top 10 → Authentication → Logic Flaws
- **Time Allocation:** 70% Hunting + 30% Learning (after Q1)
- **Testing Tools:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, custom scripts
- **Documentation:** Every bug report and learning documented
- **Community:** Engage with writeups, share learnings, help others

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Focus on Q1 foundation milestones
2. **Weekly:** Track progress in daily logs and weekly reviews
3. **Monthly:** Update this roadmap with learnings
4. **Quarterly:** Comprehensive review and strategy adjustment
